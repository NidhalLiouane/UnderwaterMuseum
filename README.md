## VR Underwater Museum.

I really enjoyed working on this project and it was a really enriching experience. 
This project could be used for educational purposes, but also for entertainement industries. 
The Underwater museum helps students see and interact with the animated fish models in their environment with many fields of view  , and live the magic of VR.
